class User:
    """
    A user in the Team Cowboy system. Users may be on one or more teams (or no 
    teams at all).

    IMPORTANT NOTE:  User profile information can be overridden for specific 
    teams that the user is a member of. Because of this, profile information 
    returned in a User object will either be for the core user profile or it 
    will be for the user in context to a specific team. This is based on the 
    API method that was called. For example, the User object returned from the 
    User_Get method call will be in context of the user themselves whereas the 
    array of User objects returned from a Team_GetRoster method call will be 
    in context of the team passed with the method call via the teamId parameter.
 
    Also note that some method calls that return User objects may return an 
    abridged version of the object which has fewer properties populated. For 
    example, Event_GetAttendanceList returns an AttendanceList object which 
    includes and object that has a User object as its property. This User 
    object does not include all of the properties listed below (such as 
    detailed contact information and profile information) because that 
    information is not relevant to displaying the attendance list.
